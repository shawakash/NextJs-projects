Google has contributed to the Next.js project, including 43 pull requests in 2019.[13] As of March 2022, the framework is used by many large websites, including Walmart, Apple, Nike, Netflix, TikTok, Uber, Lyft, and Starbucks.[9] In early 2020, Vercel secured twenty-one million dollars in Series A funding to support improvements to the software.[1] The framework's original author, Guillermo Rauch, is currently the CEO of Vercel, and the project's lead maintainer is Tim Neutkens.[14]","author":"Mesto","slug":"nextJs"}},"__N_SSG":true}
