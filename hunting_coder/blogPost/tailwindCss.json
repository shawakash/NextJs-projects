    "content": "The default mode of Tailwind is that the system generates all possible CSS combinations based on the project settings. Then, by means of another utility such as PurgeCSS, all the files are traversed, and the classes that are not being used are removed from the resulting CSS file. Due to the number of classes that can be generated by the number of variants and their combinations, this method has the drawbacks of long waiting times and large sizes of CSS files before being purged. This mode of operation is no longer available in version 3 of Tailwind CSS.[11] JIT JIT mode (Just-In-Time) is an alternative way to generate the CSS that, instead of generating all possible classes and then removing all those that are not being used, parses the content of HTML files (or configured extensions or locations) and instantly generates only those classes that are needed and used. Because all possible variables are no longer generated, the waiting time and size of the resulting CSS files is greatly reduced.[citation needed] This technical improvement has made it possible to introduce numerous new variants and utility classes, as well as the ability to create utility classes on the fly with arbitrary values ​​not set in the configuration. Starting with version 3 of Tailwind CSS, JIT mode has become the default.[11]",
